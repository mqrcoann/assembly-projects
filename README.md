# assembly projects
 some programs in MASM that i've made when i was in the university

you can run the games with the executable file inside /Release folder
run Win32App.exe

disclaimer: you may experiment a consistent screen blink
this happens because there is a code-level high frame update 
that issue may affect some computers and the way you can fixed is recompiling the file and changing the timer(where does screen refresh happens) update rate
sorry for that incovenents
